# Vehicle-Allocation-System-Based-on-Traffic-Congestion
In this research, we have worked with the problem of traffic congestion and came up with machine learning-based solutions to mitigate its effects. The prime objective of this project is to serve a machine learning-based web service that will make our day-to-day travel time much faster by partially eliminating the problem of traffic congestion. We have used past historical traffic data to feed the machine-learning models. We have used ‘Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)’ and ‘Extreme Learning Machine Ensemble Based Decision Making (ELM -EBDM)’ as our choice of machine learning models to develop the web application. Out of the two models, ‘Extreme Learning Machine Ensemble Based Decision Making (ELM -EBDM)’ produced more accurate results as it is an ensemble method that works with a variety of models. So, the result obtained is really robust and fit for real-world application. Overall, this application has shown how useful machine learning is for solving practical issues and improving road effectiveness. We think this technology has the ability to transform the transportation sector and enhance passengers' daily lives. Also, this work can contribute greatly to the economy and also to the overall betterment of the masses and have a massive impact on our world in the long run.
